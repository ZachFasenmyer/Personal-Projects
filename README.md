String-Level Encryption Program

Designed, Developed and Tested this from scratch, on my free time. It was a self-teaching experience, figuring out effective equations that could both encrypt data
and be reversed for decryption. It has 8 layers of encryption, using 5 core methods and about 7 different types of keys. Some types of encryption and keys are used multiple
times, because I was able to combine some equations. Some equations can be combined in multiple ways, creating an endless possiblity of strategies and approaches. I had
a lot of fun finding the best ways and also increasing the efficiency of each function.

While this string-level program cannot compete with bit-level, it was a great way to start and teach myself the challenges of encryption equations. I am now figuring out how
to do my own asymmetric keys and how to do bit-level. This was developed in Java, but it looks like bit-level will work better in C++.
